# Security Fix Report - Environment Variables Exposure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issue Identified

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Issue**: Hardcoded sensitive credentials in source code

## üîç What Was Fixed

### 1. **Firebase Configuration (lib/firebase.js)**

**Problem**: The Firebase configuration file contained hardcoded API keys and credentials as fallback values:

```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (INSECURE)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey:
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY ||
    "AIzaSyCW2pYuxxAzam3VZekIvpo9QOjRefJh_GE",
  authDomain:
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN ||
    "sabri-login.firebaseapp.com",
  // ... more hardcoded values
};
```

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Removed all hardcoded fallback values and added proper validation:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER (SECURE)
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  // ... no fallbacks, environment variables required
};
```

Now the application will fail fast with a clear error message if environment variables are missing, instead of using hardcoded credentials.

## üìã Files Modified

1. **lib/firebase.js**

   - Removed hardcoded Firebase credentials
   - Added environment variable validation
   - Application now requires proper .env.local configuration

2. **.env.example** (NEW)
   - Created template for environment variables
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Includes instructions for obtaining credentials

## üîí Security Best Practices Implemented

### ‚úÖ What's Now Secure:

- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ‚úÖ Environment variable validation at startup
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for missing configuration
- ‚úÖ .env.example file for team onboarding
- ‚úÖ All API routes already using environment variables correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Need to Do:

#### 1. **Secure Your .env.local File**

Your `.env.local` file contains sensitive credentials. Ensure:

```bash
# Check if .env.local is in .gitignore
cat .gitignore | grep .env.local

# If not present, add it:
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

#### 2. **Rotate Exposed Credentials**

Since credentials were in source code, they may have been exposed. Consider rotating:

- ‚úÖ **Firebase API Keys** - While Firebase API keys are safe to expose (they're designed for public use), consider:

  - Setting up Firebase Security Rules
  - Enabling App Check for additional security
  - Reviewing Authentication methods allowed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PayU Credentials** - If these were committed to Git:

  - Generate new TEST credentials from PayU dashboard
  - For production, always use different credentials

- üî¥ **MongoDB URI** - This is CRITICAL:

  - **IMMEDIATELY** change your MongoDB password
  - Update the connection string in `.env.local`
  - Never commit database credentials to Git

- üî¥ **JWT_SECRET** - This is CRITICAL:
  - Generate a new secure secret key
  - All users will need to re-login after this change

#### 3. **Generate New Secrets**

```bash
# Generate a new JWT_SECRET (in PowerShell)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Or in Unix/Git Bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

When deploying to production:

- [ ] Set all environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Use different credentials for production vs. development
- [ ] Enable Firebase Security Rules
- [ ] Enable Firebase App Check
- [ ] Use production PayU credentials (not test)
- [ ] Rotate MongoDB password
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all callback URLs
- [ ] Review and update CORS settings
- [ ] Enable rate limiting on API routes

## üìö Documentation

- See `.env.example` for all required environment variables
- See `FIREBASE-SETUP.md` for Firebase configuration
- See `PAYU-PAYMENT-SETUP.md` for PayU configuration

## ‚úÖ Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Delete your `.env.local` file temporarily
2. Start the development server
3. You should see a clear error about missing Firebase configuration
4. Restore `.env.local` and server should work normally

## üîê Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Enable Git Secrets Detection**: Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`
2. **Code Review**: Always review changes before committing
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Set up hooks to prevent committing sensitive data
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review for exposed secrets
5. **Environment Variable Management**: Use services like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for production
