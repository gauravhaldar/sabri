## üî¥ IMPORTANT: How to Identify Test vs Production Keys

### Test Environment Keys

- **Alphanumeric format**: Similar to `gtKFFx`, `eCwWELxi`
- **Shorter length**: Typically 6-8 characters
- **URL**: Used with `https://test.payu.in/_payment`

### Production Keys

- **Different format**: Alphanumeric with different pattern
- **Longer**: Usually longer than test keys
- **URL**: Used with `https://secure.payu.in/_payment`

## üìã Steps to Get CORRECT Test Credentials

### Step 1: Login to PayU Dashboard

Go to: [https://onboarding.payu.in/app/account/signin](https://onboarding.payu.in/app/account/signin)

### Step 2: Switch to TEST MODE

- Look for the **toggle/switch** on the menu bar
- Ensure it says **"TEST MODE"** or **"Test Environment"**
- **DO NOT use Production Mode** for development

### Step 3: Get Test Credentials

1. Click on **"Developer"** in the left menu
2. Select **"API Details"** tab
3. You will see:
   - **Key** (Test): e.g., `gtKFFx`
   - **Salt** (Test): e.g., `eCwWELxi`
4. Click **"Copy Key"** and **"Copy Salt"** buttons

### Step 4: Update .env.local

```bash
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your_test_key_here  # Should look like: gtKFFx
PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT=your_test_salt_here  # Should look like: eCwWELxi
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Use **TEST credentials** in development/testing
- Keep `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- Never commit credentials to Git
- Verify you're in TEST MODE before copying credentials
- Contact your PayU Account Manager if you don't have test credentials

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Use production credentials in test environment
- Hardcode credentials in source code
- Share credentials in public repositories
- Mix test and production keys
- Use production environment for testing

## üîç How to Verify You Have Test Credentials

### Test Key Characteristics:

```
‚úÖ Format: Alphanumeric (letters + numbers)
‚úÖ Length: Usually 6-8 characters
