              What is 925 Sterling Silver?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Sterling silver is an alloy composed of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% additional reinforcing elements (often
              copper). This combination boosts the jewellery&apos;s longevity without sacrificing its inherent brilliance.
              The hallmark "925" indicates genuine sterling silver and ensures purity and long-lasting quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              This combination makes 925 silver sturdy, elegant, and skin-friendly—ideal for ladies who desire
              long-lasting jewelry.

                <p>
                  Yes, 925 sterling silver is ideal for daily use since it is long-lasting, scratch-resistant, and gentle
                  on the skin. The additional alloy makes it durable enough to survive daily usage without losing its

                <p>
                  925 silver will tarnish somewhat over time due to natural oxidation, but it is simple to clean and
                  preserve. Regular washing with a soft cloth or using silver polish will rapidly restore its lustre.

                  as oxidized sets, pearl studs, stone-studded necklaces, and ethnic chokers, making it excellent for

                  Look for the "925" hallmark stamped on the jewelry. Genuine sterling silver has a beautiful white
                  lustre, weighs slightly more than fake jewelry, and does not cause skin sensitivities.
