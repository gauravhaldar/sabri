# Shipping Charges Implementation

## Overview

Implemented dynamic shipping charges based on payment method for the Sabri e-commerce frontend.

## Shipping Policy

- **Cash on Delivery (COD)**: ₹150 shipping charge
- **Online Payment**: FREE shipping (₹0)

## Changes Made

### 1. Cart Page (`app/cart/page.js`)

#### Added `calculateShipping()` Function

```javascript
const calculateShipping = () => {
  // ₹150 for Cash on Delivery, Free for Online Payment
  return paymentMethod === "cash_on_delivery" ? 150 : 0;
};
```

#### Updated `calculateTotal()` Function

- Now uses `calculateShipping()` instead of hardcoded `0`
- Shipping charges are added to the final total

#### Updated Order Placement Logic

- Shipping charges are now calculated dynamically
- Included in `orderSummary.shippingCharge` sent to backend

#### UI Updates

##### Payment Method Section

- **Cash on Delivery**: Shows "+ ₹150 shipping charge" in orange text
- **Online Payment**: Shows "Free shipping" in green text

##### Order Summary Section

- Shipping line now displays:
  - "FREE" (in green) for online payment
  - "₹150" for cash on delivery

##### Trust Badges

- Dynamically shows "Free Shipping" for online payment
- Shows "Fast Delivery" for COD

## User Experience

### Cash on Delivery Flow

1. User selects "Cash on Delivery" payment method
2. Shipping charge of ₹150 is added to order total
3. User sees clear indication: "+ ₹150 shipping charge" below payment option
4. Order summary shows shipping as ₹150

### Online Payment Flow

1. User selects "Online Payment" payment method
2. Shipping is FREE (₹0)
3. User sees clear indication: "Free shipping" below payment option
4. Order summary shows shipping as "FREE" in green
5. User also gets 5% online payment discount (as per existing logic)

## Order Summary Calculation

For example, if cart subtotal is ₹1000 and no coupon is applied:

### Cash on Delivery:

- Subtotal: ₹1000
- Shipping: ₹150
- Total: ₹1150

### Online Payment:

- Subtotal: ₹1000
- Online Payment Discount (5%): -₹50
- Shipping: FREE
- Total: ₹950

## Backend Integration

The shipping charge is included in the `orderSummary` object sent to `/api/orders/create`:

```javascript
orderSummary: {
  subtotal,
  couponDiscount,
  couponCode: appliedCoupon?.code,
  onlinePaymentDiscount: Math.round(onlinePaymentDiscount * 100) / 100,
  tax: Math.round(tax * 100) / 100,
  shippingCharge: shipping,  // ₹150 for COD, ₹0 for online
  total: Math.round(total * 100) / 100,
}
```
